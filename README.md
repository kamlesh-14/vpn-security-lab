# ProtonVPN Encryption and IP Masking Test

## Objective
Demonstrated how ProtonVPN protects user data by encrypting traffic and masking IP addresses.

## Tools Used
- ProtonVPN (Free Version)
- Browser: Chrome (for encryption check)
- Website: whatismyipaddress.com

## Steps Followed
1. Installed and configured ProtonVPN on Windows.
2. Connected to a server (e.g., Germany) via ProtonVPN.
3. Verified change in public IP address.
4. Browsed websites to confirm traffic was encrypted (checked HTTPS).
5. Disconnected VPN and compared speed and IP address.
6. Researched ProtonVPN's encryption and protocols.
7. Documented findings and added screenshots.

## Key Findings
- ProtonVPN successfully masked the original IP address.
- All traffic was encrypted through HTTPS with verified certificates.
- On disconnect, IP reverted and latency improved slightly.
- VPN adds a strong layer of security on public networks.

## VPN Benefits
- Encrypts all outgoing traffic
- Protects against IP-based tracking
- Allows access to geo-blocked content
- Enhances online privacy and anonymity

## VPN Limitations
- Can reduce internet speed
- Free version offers limited servers
- May not work on all streaming platforms

## Screenshots
-  IP before and after VPN
-  Browser HTTPS encryption
